# Cloudflare Workers project

This project uses a cloudflare worker and implements gitflow + github actions to define a development workflow for teams.

## Why

We want to avoid doing `wrangler publish` to production manually, instead we will let every developer to manage its own cloudlfare account and we will provide the github actions to automate the deployment.
